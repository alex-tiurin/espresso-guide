These professionals are testers, programmers developing tests for their code, engineers in automated and load testing, and team leads willing to improve testing efficiency in their projects. All speakers talk about the most important, practical and hardcore things on software testing:

Manual testing;
Load testing, performance testing, benchmarking;
Testing of distributed systems;
Testing of mobile applications;
UX, Security, A/B testing;
